Topic: OOP - Object Oriented Programming

-OOP runs upon Class concept

Class: class is a collection of methods(function) and properties(variable)


Origin Cause:

Procedural Programming
functions.php
---------------
function hi(){}
function hello(){}
function bye(){}
function add(){}
function sub(){}
function mul(){}
function div(){}
------------------------------------

- more structurized 
- more manageable
- less complex
- reusable

class greet{
    function hi(){}
    function hello(){}
    function bye(){}
}

class calc{
    function add(){}
    function sub(){}
    function mul(){}
    function div(){} 
}

greet.hi()
calc.add()

------------------

OOP has 4 main pillars/concepts

1. Encapsulation - class encapsulate proprties and methods in it 
2. Inheritance   - a class inharited by parant class have access to its properties and methods
3. Abstraction   - abstract class which has one/more methods created with header only, child class who inherits this class will responsible to implement body of the method.
4. Polymorphism  - many forms, same function with new body or extra args, 
                    1. method overridding
                    2. method overloading (PHP doesn't support)
